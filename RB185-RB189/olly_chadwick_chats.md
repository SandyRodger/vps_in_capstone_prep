## 13.12.23

to discuss:

- favicon middleware (am i allowed to use lint?)
- Safari doesn't render the code
- tests
- Is it ok how i enter new sets? (ie, it's not shown what the exercise ids are).
- Interview assessment
- Is it too complicated ? (What should be cut?)
- Is it ok that the exercise summary table does not allow deletion.
- Are my paths ok (too many? illogical? Page numbers?)
- logins?

Next:

- Am i doing this:
  - Display appropriate flash error messages when the user does something incorrectly. Don't fail silently, and don't rely on built-in errors from Sinatra, Rack, other packages, or a plain text error page that lacks controls such as a 404 Not Found error from your browser.![image](https://github.com/SandyRodger/RB185-RB189/assets/78854926/ff5309ca-a05b-4a7d-a847-aa0a3b90eceb)
